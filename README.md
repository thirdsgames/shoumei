# Shoumei (証明)
A mathematical proof assistant aiming for complete axiomatic correctness. Definitions, claims and proofs are written in `.shoumei` files, which are then parsed and validated by `shoumei`.

## Goals and Anti-Goals
Shoumei attempts to create an environment in which proofs of many kinds can be checked rigorously, including proofs that algorithms terminate. It does not attempt to accept all proofs, or even a majority of proofs; it simply aims to provide a language into which many proofs may be translated.
